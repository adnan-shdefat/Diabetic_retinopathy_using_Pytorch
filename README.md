# Diabetic_retinopathy_using_Pytorch
Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using deep neural network coded by PyTorch framework.

Classification problems belong to the category of machine learning problems where given a set of features, the task is to predict a discrete value. Predicting whether aan image contains signs of diabetic retinopathy or not.

The dataset contains features extracted from the Messidor image set to predict whether . All features represent either a detected lesion, a descriptive feature of a anatomical part or an image-level descriptor.
